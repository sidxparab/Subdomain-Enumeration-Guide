## Subdomain Enumeration Guide 2021 📖

This guide contains all the needed knowledge for performing a good subdomain enumeration. I have tried to cover each topic from a beginner's perspective. Each of the techniques used has a detailed explanation about why this technique was used and how to perform them. I have tried to link various gists, charts, statistics for a better understanding of the concept.

I have tried to include only those tools that yield the best results compared to other tools from the same category.

I'm too a beginner in this field and have tried my best to explain the right concepts. If you think any of the content is wrongly explained, I am always open to listening to you.

This guide may help you build your **own recon methodology**. I believe each one should have their own methodology and keep trying out new things and find out which fits best for them.

Last but not the least, I would like to thank [six2dez](https://twitter.com/Six2dez1) for helping me in creating this detailed guide.
