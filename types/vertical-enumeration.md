1. **Passive Techniques**
   * Passive Sources&#x20;
   * Certificates Logs
2. **Active Techniques**
   * DNS bruteforcing
   * Permutations/Alterations
   * JS/Source Code Scraping
   * VHOST discovery
   * Google Analytics
   * Recursive Enumeration
   * TLS, CSP, CNAME probing
   * Regex Permutations
3. **Web probing**
   * Default Ports
   * Common Ports

Each and every technique is explained in detail, so read out the whole guide. :blush:&#x20;
